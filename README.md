# AI-powered Smart Closet App for Wardrobe Organization and Recommendation

## 📌 Project Objectives

Automatically recognize the user’s existing wardrobe by analyzing their daily photos, and provide personalized outfit recommendations based on the clothes they already own, current weather conditions, and other relevant factors.

It can also recommend new clothing items to purchase based on current fashion trends and the user’s existing wardrobe, ensuring that the suggested pieces complement what they already own.

## 🎯 Target Users and Their Needs

People often struggle with organizing their closets—there are simply too many clothes to keep track of. When items aren’t stored in a visible or accessible way, it’s easy to forget what you own. This leads to underused pieces and repeated outfits.

Additionally, some people don’t know what they should add to their wardrobe to make it more versatile or stylish, which makes shopping overwhelming and inefficient.

## 🚧 Deliverables & Roadmap

### Core Features:
- Automatically detect and catalog clothing items from the user’s existing photo album (no manual scanning required)
- Generate daily outfit recommendations based on the user’s wardrobe, weather, and occasion
- Suggest new clothing items to purchase based on fashion trends and current wardrobe gaps

### Nice-to-Have Features:
- Integrate with online retailers to provide direct shopping links
- Allow users to tag or edit clothing categories manually for more accuracy
- Add a mood-based outfit generator (e.g., “cozy,” “confident,” “chill”)

### Challenges:
- Ensuring accurate detection of clothing from casual, varied photo types
- Addressing user privacy concerns related to photo access and data storage
- Creating a recommendation system that feels both stylish and personalized

### Development Roadmap:
- **Week 1–2**: UI wireframing and prototyping  
- **Week 3–4**: Clothing recognition model integration (using pre-trained computer vision models)  
- **Week 5–6**: Build wardrobe catalog and tagging system  
- **Week 7–8**: Implement recommendation engine for outfits and shopping  
- **Week 9**: User testing and UI refinement  
- **Week 10**: Final testing, polishing, and deployment

## ⚠️ Special Constraints

- **Clothing Recognition Accuracy**: Detecting and classifying clothes (type, color, texture, style) from casual photos (not isolated clothing shots) is technically challenging, especially when items are layered, folded, or partially visible.

## ✅ Expected Outcome

The final product will be a fully functional mobile-friendly app that allows users to organize their wardrobe effortlessly by analyzing existing photos. Users will be able to see a clear digital version of their closet, receive personalized outfit recommendations each day, and discover smart suggestions for what to buy next based on their style, needs, and trends.

The app aims to reduce decision fatigue, promote sustainable shopping, and enhance users’ confidence in dressing.
